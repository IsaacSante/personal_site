I don't know what's going to happen when I start a new project. Partly because it tends to be something new like a website that controls your bedroom lights based on your body movement or making shape-shifting 3D sculptures that represent a museum collection. That's the fun part, it has to do a lot with an exploration of what has been done and thinking about how to add to that to make it relevant to my clients and my work.

Im a designer first and developer second. That means innovation is secondary to the narrative we are trying to get across on the project. Sometimes that narrative is a feeling, like the interaction the website creates or the narrative is about the visual language or system being used to organize the information. The objective of these design approaches is to establish an emotional connection between the story and the reader. 

I see my work as no different from that of Arthur C. Clark who famously said, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." So everything I do revolves around the creation of magic through technology. Im also exploring visuals for music and connecting it to a midi controller or making face filters on Instagram. So magic in this sense is how we take design to not only give it motion but bring it to life through the person experiencing the technology. Then taking that and scaling it for different audiences and different contexts, from someone shopping for a product at home to someone viewing my visuals at a DJ set at a party it's all ultimately about submersion. 

## The story is king
Innovation without purpose is just adding more stuff into the digital eco-sphere. The story is the cornerstone of the website. I try to imagine how people will engage with the website and how through that engagement the user creates an emotional connection. 

## Let the user find the magic
The interaction has to be magical and equally as powerful as the story. That may mean the user's input changes the information being displayed in some way. They have to feel like they are connected to the information being displayed its what makes the information 

## Be funny. 
It has to be funny, not in an explicitly comedic sense but in the sense that the site has to be like when get catch a joke with a double meaning and it takes you a while to understand. It should take time to process and it should open your mind in the process. 

## Be elegant.
It has to make sense not only as a work of art but also as a piece of technology. That means when someone looks into how it a piece was made it has to make sense and has to be using the most up-to-date practices. This is not about the audience, this about the standard you set for yourself as a developer. I strive every day to be a better developer and still have a lot to learn.
